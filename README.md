### Installing the software environment

The whoe software environment required to reproduce these analyses can be easily installed with miniconda.


```
## List the targets
make -f scripts/makefiles/01_software-environment.mk

## Install the environment
make -f scripts/makefiles/01_software-environment.mk install_env

## See the list of targets for the other steps

```

### Analysis of the spike protein sequences

bla bla bla

The commands are specifie in the make file `make -f scripts/makefiles/03_protein-alignments.mk`. 

The list of targets can be obtained with the following command.

```
make -f scripts/makefiles/03_protein-alignments.mk
```

#### Colorizing the inserts on the 3D structural model

1. Open pymol
2. Open the script `scripts/pymol/colorize-inserts.pml`
